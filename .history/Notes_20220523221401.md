# Notes

## May 22, 2022

- Removed most boiler plate code from [[main.ts]]
- Installed Hot Reload Plugin
- Updated manifest file
- Wrote pseudo code for app with checks

- Tried to look up how to read the files from the system but there's no real Obsidian API documentation which is ass.
- Nvm lol it's under [advanced docs](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/api/classes/Vault)

- File writing done through modify command
- Updated the reset files to not delete
- Setup checkCommand instead of just addCommand

- Issues:
- Not picking up children
- Not able to run more than once
